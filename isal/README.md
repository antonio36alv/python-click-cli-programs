Making a command in case at any time I feel like I Suck At Linux (isal). This will simple keep track of commands that I have

had trouble with in the past. By trouble I simply mean commands that I need to look up on a regular basis, commands that

needed flags/arguements on the contraire to the norm/what was expected or are simply complicated (complicated enough that

I don't remember them or that it becomes complex enough that --help does not suffice).
